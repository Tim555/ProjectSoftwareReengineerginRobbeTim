\section{Tool Choice}

\subsection{Tools for Test Coverage}
To select the tool for the test coverage, we selected four of the most widely used coverage tools for Java and compared their results. The tools that were reviewed for this project were: EMMA, JaCoCo, IntelliJ IDEA built in analyzer, and Clover. The results of each tool are presented in Table \ref{testCoverageTools}.

As seen in Table \ref{testCoverageTools}, most tools produce similar results, with the exception of Clover. Clover also does not feature line coverage, but features statement coverage. However, though we would expect similar results to the line coverage, it is much less.

The built-in tool of InteliJ does not feature any way of showing the branch coverage and produced a different output in a previous run. 

This left us with two remaining tools, EMMA and JaCoCo. Both tools are able to compute the line coverage, the branch coverage, and the method coverage and produce similar results. Because the JaCoCo tool is integrated in the IDE that was used in this project and is compatible with the maven site plugin, this was the best choice for the project.
